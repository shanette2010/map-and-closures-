From the videos, I learned several key concepts:

### Closures: 
The solution code for closures was different from my own in the sense that it utilized closure properties more explicitly.
It effectively demonstrated how closures can capture and retain the outer function's variables even after the outer function has finished executing. 
The official solution video walkthrough provided a clear explanation of how closures work and how they can be utilized to create private variables and maintain state within functions.

### Map: 
The video walkthrough on map provided a comprehensive understanding of how the map method works in JavaScript arrays. 
It highlighted the functional programming aspect of JavaScript and showcased how map can be used to transform each element of an array without mutating the original array. 
I learned that map returns a new array with the results of applying a provided function to each element of the original array.

__Using map compared to a for or while loop:__

### Map:

* Offers a more concise and expressive way to iterate over arrays and apply transformations.
* Emphasizes a functional programming paradigm, promoting immutability and declarative code.
* Automatically handles the creation of a new array, avoiding the need for manual array initialization.
* Typically results in cleaner and more readable code.


### For/While Loop:


* Provides more low-level control over the iteration process, allowing for complex looping conditions.
* May be more familiar to developers coming from other programming languages.
* Requires explicit array manipulation and mutation, potentially leading to more verbose code.
* Can be less declarative and may require additional mental overhead to understand the loop's purpose and behavior.
